// zlog is a JSON-structured logging implementation of the slog.Handler interface.
// Which provides the ability to print stacktrace, a development mode that renders logs
// in a human-friendly output like zap library, the flexibility to customize the time
// formatter and other features, almost fully compatible with slog.Handler rules and
// maintaining high performance.
//
// zlog also provides a Logger for better use of formatted logging methods (xxxxf).
